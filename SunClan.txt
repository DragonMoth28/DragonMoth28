PROLOGUE 
After fleeing to the gorge, ancient Sky Clan slowly fell into decay, picked off by swarms of rats and the diseases they carried. While some became loners and rogues, or even turned to the soft life of a kittypet to survive, a few warriors fled to continue seeking a new home. As they traveled, they gathered other cats seeking a new home, before arriving in a distant land miles from the forest where the clans first founded.

Cats eventually start showing up, in terms of Minecraft cats littered around the camp. Off-screen a kittypet, named Jean based off the Ender Dragon, showed up with a near-6-month kitten, named DMM.

Cloudwing feels as if something is terribly wrong, as if something will happen, but StarClan gives no sign as to what this may be.

FUTURE
We've planned to have DMM be the Medicine Cat apprentice, but at first be planned to be a regular apprentice. DMM will be renamed to become Adderpaw. The whole idea is to have Stormmist take the newly appointed Adderpaw to show them how to swim and catch fish to prove her own worthiness, but Adderpaw will ultimately nearly drown and become absolutely terrified of large bodies of water, requesting to become Cloudwing's apprentice instead, and I'm pretty sure Stormmist is going to feel rlly bad-
